Metabolon is building the data sources and analytical tools that will help humanity understand life. Our metabolomics platform measures over 1000 biologically important molecules. This gives us an unprecedented measure of the biological state of cells, organisms, and patients. By itself, this is a valuable tool for precision medicine. When combined with other omics data, it is the Rosetta Stone that will help us understand gene function. We are looking for a data scientist with a passion for modern machine learning approaches to extract insights from our growing collection of biological data and build production systems leveraging the resulting insights. Possible Projects Include Metabolon’s coverage of the metabolite space is an order of magnitude greater than our nearest competitor. With this, we have assembled a large corpus of characteristics corresponding to the detection of individual metabolites. This role will leverage this curated data resource to improve the automation of metabolite detection. Metabolon’s instrument accuracy, reproducibility, and comparability are field leading. Nonetheless, current mass spectrometer analysis is limited to relative quantitation ex. how abundant a substance is relative to something else. Our technical sophistication has allowed us to push the boundary of this limitation and approximate absolute quantitation ex. the concentration of a substance in a mixture. This role will leverage our data to predict absolute concentrations with corresponding confidence distributional bounds. Coupled with our best in world metabolite coverage, this is a killer app. Metabolon’s historical data and continual integration with large cohort studies enable us to characterize phenotypes ex. disease states and their underlying metabolomic and potential other omics sources to an unprecedented degree. This role will leverage their skills to extract meaningful structures ex. an underlying structure which might consume a metabolic profile and output a distance” to a disease state in support of biological insights into fundamental questions of human health. Examples of Useful Experience Excellent data scientists come from a wide variety of backgrounds. The list below is neither exhaustive nor completely required; if you can code and think your talents can help us, start a conversation even if not all the boxes below are checked.

Your Role The Data Scientist works with the business stakeholders to identify what the business requirements are and the expected outcome. Model and frame business scenarios that are meaningful and which impact on critical business processes and or decisions. Working with and alongside business analysts. This can be business requirements, such as reducing churn for mobile providers for example, or increasing cross sell of products by suggesting other products of interest to the client. Identify what data is available and relevant, including internal and external data sources, leveraging new data collection processes such as smart meters and geo location information or social media. Additionally, the cost of getting the data will impact on what sources should be considered, either because the data needs to be purchased from a third party or because of the complexity of the source. The data scientist will need to work with business subject matter experts to select what the relevant sources of information are. Work with the data steward to ensure that the information used follows the compliance, access management and control policies of the organization and that it meets the qualification and assurance requirements of the business. Data stewards and data scientists will need to define the data quality expectation in the context of the specific use case. Work in iterative processes with the business and validate findings. For example, validate discovered correlations across data with the business. Discovered findings can appear counter intuitive. Data scientists need to be able to expose the rationale to their findings in easy to understand terms for the business. Data scientists should be prepared to present back results that contradict common belief. Include experimental design approaches to validate findings. Data scientists will need to validate analysis by comparing appropriate samples. In the case of clickstream analysis, it is easy to measure the impact of suggestions on total sales by splitting the users into two populations, one with and one without the recommendation engine. However, similar approaches to validation need to be identified regardless of the use case. Suggest ongoing improvements to methods and algorithms that lead to findings, including new information. For example, refining suggestions based on clients’ interests, geographic location, age or gender, rather than just based on overall buying pattern. Understand the use and ability to employ the appropriate algorithm to discover patterns. Examples include using statistical and data mining packages and dedicated frameworks such as Hadoop MapReduce. Work with IT to support data collection, integration and retention requirements based on the input collected with the business. Examples here may include activities such as the definition of the blog collection process, definition and selection of the proper data infrastructure to perform the analysis, definition of the perishability of the data and the data archiving technology used to support the life cycle management of the data. The combination of the tools selected is likely to be very dependent on the use case and the assessment done along the 12 dimensions of big data extreme information. Educate the organization both from IT and the business perspectives on these new approaches, such as testing hypotheses and statistical validation of results. Given how new these approaches may seem too many people, it may come across as esoteric.
