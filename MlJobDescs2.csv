 The situated interaction research effort at MSR AI aims to enable computers to reason more deeply about their surroundings and engage in fluid interaction with humans in physically situated settings. When people interact with each other, they engage in a rich, highly coordinated, mixed initiative process, regulated through both verbal and non verbal channels. In contrast, while their perceptual abilities are improving, computers are still unaware of their physical surroundings and of the physics” of human interaction. Current human computer interaction models assume there is a single user, engaging with full attention on a single computer system. Computers do not yet understand engagement, attention, proximity, interruptability, turn taking, group dynamics, social expectations, human memory and goals, and so on. Our research aims to address these challenges and create the basis for a new generation of situated systems that are capable of fluid interactions and collaborations with people.
